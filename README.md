# chatbot
SmartChat is a lightweight, rule-based chatbot built using Python that uses an intents.xml file to manage conversations instead of relying on machine learning or external APIs. It works by matching user input against predefined patterns and returning a random, appropriate response from the matched intent. Designed for simplicity and clarity, this project is ideal for beginners who want to learn the fundamentals of chatbot logic, XML parsing, and basic natural language processing techniques without the complexity of neural networks. The chatbot runs in any terminal, requires no external Python libraries, and is fully customizableâ€”just add new <intent> blocks to the XML file to teach it new topics. It serves as a great base for future enhancements like GUI interfaces, voice integration, or web deployment via Flask.
